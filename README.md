# ReadyBot Templates

This repo contains all the boilerplate for creating Discord bots, it's incomplete at the moment lol

## What libraries on each languages are using?

I'll try to use up-to-date libaries on their corresponding language, if there are any
issues, feel free to send a PR!

- JavaScript/TypeScript uses Discord.js
- Python uses nextcord
- C# uses DSharpPlus
